TODO:
	* extract images for progress bar (top of widget), pattern image (bottom of widget), and check sign (for email verification experience)
	* try to use css transform to bring check mark? Maybe use :before and :after to add dynamic styles. if doesn't work, use jquery.
	* pixel-perfect widths and heights
	* get exact colors from comp
	* create mixins (or polyfills) to implement unsupported CSS3
	* less @import's are relative (should be rooted to somewhere useful)
	* Move script/styles dependency pairs into their own directories?

IF TIME TODO:
	* Use browser geolocation API to auto-detect city/state/zip code (and apply style showing these were auto-populated and should be reviewed by the user) https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/
	* Unit testing for JS modules. Should have done TDD, really.
	* Coerce state input into upper-case

NOTES:
	* CORS issue requires Chromium to be launched as: chromium -allow-file-access-from-files
	* "First Name"/"Last Name" may not be sensible for names that come from certain cultures

<!--
	I have assumed that all of the fields (except for "Middle Initial" and "Suffix") are required fields.
	I have somewhat overengineered this, but I did this in order to exhibit organization...
	Regular expressions used in patterns probably don't work with certain edge cases.

	There can probably be some code cleanup and performance optiimizations (especially) with the JS, but I focused more on user experience for a first cut...

	JS required to prevent :valid and :invalid from being styled before user has had chance to insert any information

	I generally try to follow SMACSS...
	I like to alphabetize selectors and properties (except I like place mixin invocations before CSS properties and CSS properties before nested selectors inside less/sass. This seems to cause the least specificity issues...
	Tried to be as semantic as I understand the HTML5 elements to be, but I may not be entirely correct...
	Conventions used...

	Design enhancements:
		* display to user which step he/she is in within this (apparently) multi-step process
		* "Learn More" hover styles and tooltip text
		* red border on invalid inputs
		* submit hover styles
		* The corners of fieldsets don't remain perfectly rounded after validation styles are applied; there didn't seem to be a quick and clean way to do this.
		* Changed color of the persisted placeholder (that looked too much like a link to me)
	
	Future design enhancements (given more time):
		* Autocomplete the "State" input
		* Autocomplete the "Suffix" field with a list of common suffixes
		* Autofill City/State/Zip code fields as soon as possible (by hitting some kind of address verification service)
		* Use some kind of module loader to allow for dependency injection (just so that it's obvious that my custom modules depend on jQuery)
